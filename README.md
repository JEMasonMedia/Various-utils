# Various Utilities for VPS and Development Setup

This repository contains a growing collection of shell utilities designed to streamline the setup of development and production environmentsâ€”particularly when working with VPS deployments or rebuilding systems after breaking changes.

These scripts automate everything from package installation to Strapi project initialization, FTP configuration, SSH access, and more. The goal is to provide a reliable and repeatable toolset that minimizes human error and accelerates setup time.
